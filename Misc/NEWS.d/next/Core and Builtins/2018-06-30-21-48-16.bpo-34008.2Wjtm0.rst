Make it explicit that we expect ``Py_Main`` to typically be called instead
of ``Py_Initialize`` rather than after it (since ``Py_Main`` makes its own
call to ``Py_Initialize``). However, also document that calling both is
supported, but it's version dependent as to exactly which settings
will be applied correctly in that case.

Also add Py_IsInitialized to the list of APIs that are safe to call before
the interpreter is initialized, and update the embedding tests to cover it.
